# Read-it
Read-it is an application that's built as **1.** a study project to learn ES6 **2.** a way to store and read my articles **3.** read the articles you liked to read.

## The problem
Whenever I see an article I want to read, but not right now, I save it as a Bookmark, store it in a Trello board, add it to a Google Docs file, download the URL or create a massive amount of tabs that I eventually close because my computer get's too slow. So I currently don't have a good way to save my articles and no motivations to read them later on, since my lists get so long I don't even know where to start.

## The solution
Every week I try to read the Smashing Magazine reading list because on every Saturday morning I get an email as a notification. That works, so why not create your own reading list?

If you find an article you want to read, add it to your list with the browser plugin. Add tags to sort the articles or add it to a company's reading list. So if your company is called Read-it, add the tag Read-it and on every (day you select in a week), the Reading list is sent to all the subscribers of that list. This means all the people in your company create the reading list together.
